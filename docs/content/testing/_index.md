## Run the harness locally

The local-invocation pattern depends on the consumer repo's setup. Two
working examples today:

**Pattern A — consumer ships Makefile targets that drive the harness
from a sibling clone.** Recommended for repos where multiple developers
will run tests regularly. Targets are prefixed `framework-test-*` so they
don't collide with the `test-*` namespace some consumers reserve for doc
tests (code blocks executed against a cluster):

```sh
# One-time: clone docs-theme-extras as a sibling
git clone https://github.com/solo-io/docs-theme-extras ../docs-theme-extras
cd <consumer-repo>
make framework-test-install        # npm + Playwright browsers in the sibling

# Build the test fixture / site, then run a project
make framework-test                # all projects (static, browser, cross-browser)
make framework-test-static         # fastest loop — ~2s after Hugo build
make framework-test-browser        # chromium only
make framework-test-cross-browser  # chromium + firefox + webkit
make framework-test-content CONTENT_DIR=<product>   # scope content scan to one product subtree (hubs)

# Override the sibling location if needed
make framework-test FRAMEWORK_EXTRAS_DIR=/abs/path/to/docs-theme-extras
```

The sibling-clone pattern, the `FRAMEWORK_EXTRAS_DIR` override variable,
and the per-target signatures are conventions a Makefile-shipping consumer
opts into. See `Makefile` examples in the consumer repos for the full template.

**Pattern B — consumer invokes the harness directly.** Works for any
consumer without Makefile scaffolding; useful as a starter or for
ad-hoc runs:

```sh
# One-time: clone docs-theme-extras as a sibling and install
git clone https://github.com/solo-io/docs-theme-extras ../docs-theme-extras
cd ../docs-theme-extras && npm ci && npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Build the consumer site, then run the harness against it
cd <consumer-repo> && hugo --gc --minify
cd ../docs-theme-extras && \
  DOCS_TEST_CONFIG=$(pwd)/../<consumer-repo>/.docs-test.toml \
  npx playwright test --project=static
```

Either pattern resolves `builtRoot` from the consumer's `.docs-test.toml`,
so any consumer can run the same harness against its own `public/` once
the config is in place.

## Why a consumer may run fewer specs than the module's self-test

A consumer that imports the module will see strictly fewer Playwright tests
than `make test-oss` / `make test-enterprise` runs against the bundled
fixture. This is by design, not a bug — different specs need different
inputs, and a real product site can't provide all of them.

Four mechanisms determine which specs run for a given `.docs-test.toml`:

### 1. Fixture-aware specs require `/everything/` and `/rebased/` pages

These specs were written against the bundled fixture, which contains a
`/everything/` page (calls every shortcode the framework cares about) and
a `/rebased/` page (alternate-render path). Each spec greps `target.pages`
for a URL ending in those segments; if neither match, the whole spec is
`test.skip`'d. Affected specs:

- `browser.spec.ts` — tabs, mermaid SVG, copy-md script, theme toggle, console errors
- `cross-browser.spec.ts` — same checks across chromium/firefox/webkit
- `presence.spec.ts` — DOM-structure assertions
- `auto-cards.spec.ts` — `<div class="hextra-cards">` child assertions
- `github-shortcode.spec.ts` — `{{</* github */>}}` rendered-body presence
- `versioning.spec.ts` — needs `/everything/` to exist under each declared version

To opt in, declare `[[pages]]` entries in your `.docs-test.toml` whose URLs
end in `/everything/` and `/rebased/`. Real product docs rarely have pages
that call every shortcode in one place, so most consumers leave these
specs off and rely on the module's own self-test for fixture-dependent
checks.

### 2. `[checks]` table can disable specs explicitly

```toml
[checks]
codeBlockIntegrity = false   # e.g. a consumer with a known backlog of fenced-block fragmentation
```

All checks default to enabled. Setting `false` skips that spec entirely.

### 2a. `[crawl].maxFiles` caps the browser crawl

```toml
[crawl]
maxFiles = 0   # 0 = unlimited; default 50
```

Only the browser crawl (`console-errors.spec.ts`, the `browser-crawl`
project) is capped — opening pages in Chromium is expensive, so it samples 50
by default. Set `maxFiles = 0` to open every built page. The cheap file-read
scans (`content` project) always walk every page regardless.
For the consumer's own build the static project already crawls
everything, so the default cap is the right choice.

### 2b. `[[gateAxes]]` enables gate-axis-collision.spec

```toml
[[gateAxes]]
name      = "oss site"
condition = "kubernetes"     # url mode: the condition IS the section
sections  = []

[[gateAxes]]
name      = "docs-hub / agentgateway"
condition = "agentgateway"   # siteParams mode: a product id
sections  = ["kubernetes", "standalone"]
```

`conditional-text` gates on two axes — the build condition and the page's
section segment — through one token namespace, so a token that names a section
on one axis and a product on the other is true twice and both sides of an
intended either/or render. Each entry describes one build **the same source
tree ships through**; the lint reports a gate pair only when some
(condition, section) combination fires both, through different axes.

List the downstream build as well as your own, because that is the point of the
check: your build renders correctly and the breakage appears only in the other
one.

**Two ways to get `sections` wrong**, both of which produce noise rather than
silence, so they show up the first time you run it:

- **A `url`-mode build takes `sections = []`.** There the condition IS the
  section, so the sections are enumerated by having one entry per section. Give
  such an entry a section list as well and you ask the lint about states that
  cannot exist — condition `kubernetes` with section `standalone` — and every
  legitimate section pair reports.
- **List only sections that resolve for that build**, not every key registered
  or inherited. A hub that inherits section keys from an imported module but
  serves those pages at `/<product>/<version>/` resolves none of them, because
  `utils/section-segment.html`'s positional rule refuses them; the effective
  list is `[]`.

With no `[[gateAxes]]` the spec **skips** rather than passes — with no
combinations there is nothing to evaluate against, and a green run would be a
false all-clear. Needs `scanRoots` too, since it reads source, not built HTML.

### 2c. `[limits].maxFileMiB` sets the per-file size limit

```toml
[limits]
maxFileMiB = 2048   # default 25
```

`file-size.spec.ts` (`content` project) fails if any file in `builtRoot` is
larger than `maxFileMiB`, and warns without failing above 80% of it. It checks
every file type, not only HTML, because host limits do.

The default, 25 MiB, is the Cloudflare Pages per-file limit. A file over it
fails the whole deploy. A consumer on another host sets that host's limit
instead. The docs hub, on Firebase Hosting, sets `2048` (2 GB). To skip the
check entirely, set `[checks] fileSize = false`.

### 3. `buildLog` enables hugo-warnings.spec

```toml
buildLog = "./.build.log"   # path the harness reads for Hugo warnings
```

The Hugo-warnings spec parses the build log for unallowlisted warnings.
If `buildLog` isn't set, the spec skips. The consumer's make/CI must
arrange for Hugo to write the log at that path (`hugo > .build.log 2>&1`).

### 4. `scanRoots` controls source-side lints

```toml
scanRoots = ["./content/docs"]
```

Source-tree lints (currently `curl-quotes.spec.ts`) walk every `*.md`
under each listed root. An empty or omitted list means the lint skips —
useful when a corpus has too many pre-existing violations to ratchet
in one go.

### What still runs without any of the above

Specs that operate on the whole built tree by crawling `builtRoot` work
for every consumer regardless of `[[pages]]`:

- `static.spec.ts` — shortcode delimiter leaks, raw markdown bleed,
  copy-as-md script presence, image alt text
- `file-size.spec.ts` — every built file under `[limits].maxFileMiB`
  (default 25), see 2c
- `navbar-icon-color.spec.ts` — every navbar `<svg>` icon takes its color
  from the theme: no hardcoded `fill` or `stroke`, and no shape left with no
  fill, which SVG paints black. It samples 40 pages, because the navbar is the
  same on every page of a build. Run it on the real product build, not only the
  fixture: an imported site's `data/icons.yaml` can replace a theme icon, and
  only the real build shows it. An icon shown in one theme only, under a
  `dark:hidden` wrapper or a `hidden dark:inline-block` one, may use a fixed
  color, so a black/white pair passes. The check still flags such an icon
  when it is black on dark, set or by having no fill, or white on light. It
  matches only the literal spellings (`black`, `#000`, `white`, `#fff`, and
  so on), so a theme-only icon in any other color is not checked for
  contrast. Paint is read in the browser's order: inline style, then class,
  then the `fill`/`stroke` attribute. A fill or stroke set in CSS on the HTML
  around the icon is inherited. Tailwind's `fill-current` and
  `stroke-current` classes count as `currentColor`, and a `dark:` paint class
  such as `fill-black dark:fill-white` counts as following the theme.
  Tailwind palette colors (`fill-white`, `fill-gray-500`) and arbitrary
  values (`fill-[#fff]`) count as that color. Any other color name, such as
  `fill-secondary-link`, is a color from the site's own theme and is
  trusted. To skip it, set
  `[checks] navbarIconColor = false`.
- `contrast.spec.ts` / `viewport.spec.ts` (mostly) — sampled across
  crawled pages

So the floor for any consumer is structural HTML quality. Fixture-driven
interactive checks are bonus coverage that only the module's self-test
(or a consumer that ships a synthetic fixture page) can provide.
