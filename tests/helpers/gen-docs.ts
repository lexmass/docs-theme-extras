// gen-docs — generate the docs site's shortcode reference from the comment
// headers in layouts/_shortcodes/, and the themeExtras params reference from
// the config keys actually read across layouts/ and assets/.
//
// The contract this parses is specified in MAINTAINING.md, "The shortcode
// header contract". If the two disagree, that document is right.
//
// Relationship to scan-docs.ts: scan-docs uses a deliberately GENEROUS matcher
// (a param counts as documented if its name appears anywhere in the block),
// which was correct for sizing the backfill and is useless as a contract. This
// file has the STRICT parser. Both exist on purpose — scan-docs answers "how
// much work is left", gen-docs answers "is this file conformant".
//
// Usage (from the repo root):
//   npm run gen:docs              # write the tree
//   npm run gen:docs -- --check   # exit non-zero if regenerating would change
//   npm run gen:docs -- --json    # machine-readable parse results
//
// This module is import-only; the CLI entry point lives in scripts/, outside
// playwright's testDir — same reasoning as scan-overrides.ts, which see.

/**
 * Pages under OUT_SHORTCODES that no longer have a source shortcode.
 *
 * ONLY a page whose `layouts/_shortcodes/<name>.html` is GONE counts. A page is
 * NOT orphaned merely because it is absent from `files` — a shortcode whose
 * header fails to parse is `skipped`, so it contributes no page, and treating
 * that as an orphan meant a ONE-CHARACTER TYPO in a header deleted that
 * shortcode's entire documentation page.
 *
 * Measured, not hypothesised: renaming `Summary:` to `Summry:` in table.html
 * made `npm run gen:docs` report `removed: 1 (orphaned)` and unlink
 * `docs/content/authoring/shortcodes/table.md`, while rewriting 21 other pages
 * because the index and every subsequent weight shifted. The word "orphaned"
 * reads as deliberate cleanup, so the deletion was easy to wave through in a
 * 22-file diff — and the actual cause, a typo, was named nowhere in it.
 *
 * Keying on the source file separates the two cases: a genuinely deleted or
 * renamed shortcode still gets its page removed, and a broken header now leaves
 * the page untouched while `formatSkipped` and the docs-coverage spec report the
 * header itself.
