// The two prose-column extension slots in `layouts/docs/single.html` render
// where their names say they do, and an unused slot still costs nothing.
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG. `docs/after-title.html` shipped rendering AFTER the page
// description. agentgateway.dev is the one consumer that overrides it, for its
// doc-test "Verified" badge, and the fork the slot replaced had put that badge
// between the `<h1>` and the description. So adopting the slot silently moved
// the badge down a line. Nothing failed: the slot's own file said "after the
// page title and description", the build was green, and the only way to notice
// was to look at a rendered page and remember what it used to look like. 0.3.8
// moves the behavior to meet the name and adds `after-description.html` at the
// old position.
//
// WHY THIS IS MOSTLY A SOURCE LINT. Both slots are EMPTY by default — that is
// the whole point of the byte-identity guarantee in single.html's header
// comment — so a fixture page renders exactly the same whether the calls are
// ordered correctly or not. Covering the position end-to-end would need the
// fixture to override a slot, and it structurally cannot: hugo-oss.toml mounts
// `layouts` before `fixture/layouts`, so the module's own default wins the
// filename conflict. Verified by trying it — a probe partial at
// `fixture/layouts/partials/docs/after-title.html` rendered zero times in a
// clean build. Making it win means letting the fixture shadow ANY module
// partial, which is a much larger hole than this test is worth.
//
// Per tests/HAZARDS.md, a test that cannot fail is worse than no test, so the
// position is pinned where it is actually decided: in the template source. The
// built-output half below covers the other half of the contract — that an
// empty slot still emits nothing — which IS observable on the fixture.
//
// SCOPE, stated plainly. This proves the slot CALLS are ordered correctly and
// that the defaults stay empty. It does not prove any particular consumer's
// override looks right; that is the consumer's own test.
