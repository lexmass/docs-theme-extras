# hard-reload the browser (Cmd+Shift+R) to flush its CSS cache — Hugo
# re-emits CSS at the same URL paths, so a soft reload reuses the old.

# *-local.toml: hugo-docs.toml's baseURL is absolute
# (https://solo-io.github.io/docs-theme-extras/), and `hugo server` swaps the
# host for localhost while KEEPING the path, so the site mounts under the
# subpath and previews the same shape Pages publishes. That is the point — the
# subpath is the part most likely to break, so previewing without it would
# defeat the purpose. It also means the URL is not plain localhost:1313.

# ── Static brand builds ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Production-shaped baseURL ("/test") so paths match what consumer repos
# emit. Each brand has its own publishDir so they don't clobber each other.

# Hugo's publishDir ("public-<brand>/test") only ever emits under the "/test"
# baseURL path, so a literal root-absolute reference in content (e.g.
# "/images/logo.svg", meant to resolve at true domain root regardless of the
# docs subpath) has nowhere to land. The harness's builtRoot ("public-<brand>",
# see fixture/.docs-test-*.toml) is the parent of that "test" dir precisely to
# give such assets a place to live — mirror fixture/static there too so
# card-image.spec.ts's ROOTED case has a real file to resolve against.
# The `rm -rf` before each cp is load-bearing on a REBUILD. Hugo only owns
# "public-<brand>/test" (its publishDir), so "public-<brand>/images" survives a
# rebuild, and `cp -r src dst` copies INTO dst when dst already exists — giving
# "public-<brand>/images/images/…" on the second run and every run after. That
# silently adds files to the tree, which breaks byte-diffing one build against
# another; it is the technique used to prove a theme change altered nothing, so
# a stale nested copy shows up as phantom "only in" entries.
# The 404 copy mirrors PRODUCTION, it is not a test convenience. Hugo publishes
# 404.html under the baseURL path ("public-<brand>/test/404.html"), but every
# static host looks for it at the SERVED ROOT — which is why solo-io/docs already
# runs `cp public/<product>/404.html public/404.html` in both
# .github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml and oss-rebuild-in-ent.yml.
# Reproducing that here is what lets tests/not-found.spec.ts request a path that
# genuinely does not exist and be served the theme's 404 with a real 404 status,
# exactly as Firebase does. Without it the harness's `npx serve` answers with its
# own built-in 404 page and the spec tests nothing.

# VERSION-LESS fixture (hugo-flat.toml): parallel doc sets registered under

# separate BUILD rather than a separate harness TARGET: tests/section-
# versionless.spec.ts reads public-flat/ directly, so this needs no
# .docs-test TOML, no extra playwright project and no extra CI leg. See that
# spec's header for why.
# Two builds, one per half of the positional test in utils/section-segment.html:
# hugo-flat.toml puts the docs root in the baseURL (kagent's real shape, the
# PRIMARY rule), hugo-flat-root.toml puts it in a content directory named docs/
# (the `docs`-ALTERNATIVE rule). The spec asserts against both.

# The module's own docs site → public-docs/, uploaded by pages.yml.
#
# No post-build fixups. The brand builds have to copy fixture/static/images and
# hoist 404.html because their baseURL ("/test") buries the whole site one level
# down inside publishDir; this build's baseURL path IS the Pages subpath, so
# content already lands at the root of public-docs/ where deploy-pages expects
# it.
#
# --minify matches what a real docs host serves. It is also the one flag here
# with a known hazard: minification strips attribute quotes, so any spec later
# pointed at public-docs/ must be quote-agnostic. Nothing reads this output
# today.

# NO SECTIONS AT ALL — the agentregistry.dev / ambientmesh.io shape, and the one
# place `conditional-text` used to be inert rather than merely limited. Two
# builds because the two halves cannot coexist in one config: hugo-nosections
# sets `buildCondition` so gates resolve through the fallback, hugo-nosections-bare
# sets nothing so they stay inert and must WARN. Asserted by

# SECTION SELECTOR WITH A CONFIGURED BUTTON TITLE, on a VERSIONED site — the
# docs-hub agentgateway shape. An overlay on hugo-oss.toml (comma-joined, later
# file wins) rather than a fixture of its own, so it inherits that build's
# content and versions and differs only in publishDir and the one param. Read
# directly by tests/section-dropdown-title.spec.ts; see hugo-section-title.toml

# THE DEV-SERVER baseURL SHAPES — what `hugo server` hands utils/resolve-link.html,
# which no other config here builds. FOUR overlays, on two axes.
#
# Axis one is the shape, and there are two because `hugo server` rewrites a
# baseURL differently depending on whether it already names a host:
#   *-devpath.toml   a FULL base with a path   http://localhost:1313/docs/
#                    (a consumer that sets baseURL = "https://kagent.dev/docs/")
#   *-protorel.toml  a PROTOCOL-RELATIVE base  //localhost:1313///test/
#                    (a consumer whose baseURL is path-only, like "/test")
# The second is not a spelling variant of the first: the origin cut that yields
# the baseURL path leaves "///test" on it, which matches nothing in the
# normalized $versionRoot, so the strip misses and the path gets applied twice.
#
# Axis two is the $versionRoot derivation, which sits on the versioned /
# version-less split — version-root.html against .Page.FirstSection.RelPermalink
# — and a fix verified on one derivation says nothing about the other:
#   hugo-oss-*.toml   versioned  (hugo-oss.toml base)
#   hugo-flat-*.toml  flat       (hugo-flat.toml base)
#
# All four are static builds, so tests/dev-subpath-baseurl.spec.ts reads them
# like any other built output — no dev server. See any toml for its own shape.
#
# Named build-devpath, NOT build-oss-devpath: it builds flat trees as well as
# versioned ones, and it is a prerequisite of test-enterprise as well as test-oss.
# A brand in the name would be wrong on both counts.

# is not) and each needs its own output for the spec to compare. See

# ── Tests against the bundled fixture ────────────────────────────────────

# build-flat runs alongside each brand build so section-versionless.spec.ts has
# something to read. It is brand-independent (the version-less code paths do not
# touch the brand layer), so both brand runs assert against the same output —
# cheap, and it keeps `make test-oss` self-contained.
#
# build-devpath is listed in BOTH targets for the same reason, and it is not
# optional: CI runs the brands as separate matrix jobs (`make test-${brand}`) on
# separate runners, so a fixture listed under one target does not exist in the
# other job — and dev-subpath-baseurl.spec.ts, like every spec here, SKIPS on a
# missing build rather than failing. Dropping it from one target would have cost
# nothing visible and half the coverage.
