# Consumer overrides that shadow this module

Regenerate with `npm run scan:overrides` from the repo root, with the consumer clones as
siblings. Snapshot taken 2026-08-05 against unreleased `docs-theme-extras` — see the
Unreleased section of `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Why this file exists

A change that is correct in extras can still be a regression on a consumer that carries
its own copy of the thing being changed. That is not hypothetical — it happened with the
ordered-list counter fix in the Unreleased section. That fix was right in the module, but
the docs hub duplicated those rules in `assets/css/custom.css`, and `custom.css` is
concatenated **after** the module stylesheet, so an equal-specificity copy wins. With only the pin bumped, the hub got
the theme's new `content: counter(list-item, …)` while the hub's own
`counter-increment: … list-item 0` still pinned the counter — markers stopped incrementing
entirely, which is worse than the bug being fixed. It was found by eye, on a real build,
after the fixture was fully green.

**The fixture cannot catch this class of problem.** The bundled fixture ships a bare
`custom.css` specifically so the shared layers are tested without per-repo paint — so it
exercises a CSS environment that *no real consumer has*.

## The three mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Why it is easy to miss |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Same-path file** — consumer `layouts/<p>` beats module `layouts/<p>` | Visible to a filename diff, but nothing enumerates it |
| 2 | **Duplicated CSS selector** — consumer CSS redefines a selector extras owns | *No filename collision at all.* `custom.css` is a legitimate per-repo file; the clash is at the selector level and only shows up in rendered output |
| 3 | **Divergent markup contract** — an override emits different class names | Silently scopes any extras spec matching those classes to the fixture only |

`assets/css/custom.css` is excluded from mechanism 1: it is a per-repo slot every consumer
is *meant* to replace. What is not intended is that file redefining extras' selectors,
which is mechanism 2.

## Snapshot

Current, 2026-09-22. "Duplicated selectors" counts REAL conflicts only — the consumer and
extras set at least one property in common. A selector they merely share the NAME of is not
duplication and is not counted; see the note under kagent/ambientmesh for why that
distinction mattered.

"Same-path shadows" now EXCLUDES extension-slot overrides, which are counted separately
and are not drift — see "Extension slots" below. Folding the two together would have shown
agentgateway-oss going from 5 shadows to 8 at the exact moment it stopped forking two
layouts, which is the opposite of the signal this table is for.

| consumer | same-path shadows | slot overrides (OK) | duplicated selectors | of which divergent | contract divergences |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| docs | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| kgateway-oss | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| agentgateway-oss-website | 4 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| agentregistry-oss-website | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| kagent-oss-website | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| ambientmesh.io | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

Two of the counts moved because the MODULE grew, not because a consumer drifted: `tabs.html`
started shadowing on the hub when extras began shipping a `tabs` shortcode, and kagent's four
forks were always there but were never baselined. A row going up is not by itself a
regression — read the per-consumer verdict tables, which say which direction each one is
travelling.

## Extension slots

`layouts/partials/docs/{chrome-top,chrome-bottom,width-class,content-class,under-heading,after-title,after-description}.html`
are OVERRIDE POINTS. A consumer replacing one is using the module correctly; a consumer
replacing `layouts/docs/single.html` is not. The distinction is the whole reason the slots
were added — a forked layout silently stops receiving new module features, which cost
kgateway.dev a visible page subtitle on 856 pages. Full contract in [`MAINTAINING.md`](./MAINTAINING.md#extension-slots--override-these-instead-of-forking-a-docs-layout).

For history, the counts before this round of cleanup were: docs 8 shadows / 169 duplicated
selectors, kgateway-oss 4 / 1, agentgateway-oss 9 / 12, agentregistry 1 / 0, kagent 0 / 13,
ambientmesh 0 / 3. Unsanctioned template shadows are now **7 across all six consumers**,
down from 22: 4 on docs, 1 on kgateway-oss, 2 on agentgateway-oss, 0 elsewhere. Every one
that remains has a measured verdict saying why it stays — or, for two of the four on docs,
a measured verdict saying it should go and has not yet. **CSS duplication is now zero everywhere except one deliberate brand
font.** What remains is same-path template shadows, which are a separate and harder problem
— several are load-bearing, not stale.

### docs — the big one

**169 duplicated selectors in `custom.css`, 147 of them byte-identical to extras.** This is
not a stray copy; it is a near-wholesale duplication of extras' CSS layer. The ordered-list
block fixed in that same batch was *one of these*.

The 22 divergent ones share a single pattern: **the hub hardcodes hex colors where extras
uses brand custom properties.**

```
.content a              hub: color:#158bc2;font-weight:500
                     extras: font-weight:500
.section-card:hover     hub: border-color:#158bc2; box-shadow:… rgba(21,139,194,.1)
                     extras: border-color:var(--theme-primary); box-shadow:… var(--theme-primary-tint)
#solo-back-to-top:hover hub: background:#106a94
                     extras: background:var(--theme-primary-hover)
```

So `custom.css` is a **stale snapshot of extras' CSS from before the brand-token refactor**.
Consequence: for those selectors the hub is not receiving extras' theming at all, and any
future extras change to them is silently discarded. A handful are genuinely different rather
than merely stale and need a judgment call, notably `.section-card-image` (extras adds
`max-height` / `object-fit`), `.page-description` (`margin-top` −0.5rem vs 1.25rem),
`.solo-footer-inner` (extras adds `text-align:center`) and `.dark .solo-footer`
(transparent vs dark background).

Same-path template shadows: `card.html`, `cards.html`, `tabs.html`. (`gloss.html` and
`table.html` were deleted in v0.2.0-beta.3 — see below.)

| shadow | measured verdict |
|---|---|
| `layouts/_shortcodes/card.html` | **KEEP — deleting BREAKS THE BUILD.** Its own header comment says why: "Hextra's card uses utils/icon.html (SVG lookup) but docs uses Material Icons font." The hub passes Material Icons names (`open_in_new`, `rocket`) and renders `<i class="material-icons">`; extras looks the name up in `site.Data.icons` and `errorf`s when absent. The hub's `data/icons.yaml` has **2 entries**, both product logos. Deleting produced `ERROR icon "open_in_new" not found` and a failed build. Same shape as the `link-hextra` forks: an adaptation to a different convention, not a stale copy |
| `layouts/_shortcodes/cards.html` | **KEEP.** Pairs with `card.html`; same icon contract |
| `layouts/_shortcodes/tabs.html` | **KEEP — deleting BREAKS THE BUILD, measured.** New to this list only because extras started shipping a `tabs` shortcode in the unreleased tag; the hub's copy predates it by a long way and shadowed nothing before. Deleting it and building `gateway` against extras fails: `content/en/gateway/1.19.x/traffic-management/transformations/template-overview.md` → `{{< reuse >}}` → `RenderString` → `tabs` → Hextra's partial calls `markdownify` on tab content that is ALREADY rendered HTML, and the Inja examples in `assets/gateway-docs/pages/traffic-management/transformation-template.md` (`{{ header("bar") }}`, 19 such lines) have been Chroma-highlighted into `{{`+`<span…`, which the second pass lexes as a shortcode call — `failed to extract shortcode: template for shortcode "span" not found`, build aborted. The hub's `tab.html` sets an `isRendered` flag for exactly this and its `tabs.html` skips the second `markdownify`; extras' copy does not, because on stock Hextra the content arrives as raw Markdown. **The fork also owns two things extras has no equivalent for**: the translation export branch (`hugo.Environment == "translation"`, live in `translate-sync-ja.yml` and `scripts/export-copy-md-en.py`, which keeps `{{< tabs >}}` as source lines in the JA snapshot instead of flattening to `**Option:**`), and the whole-expansion-on-one-line `&#10;` encoding. Its variant-A markup also has no `role`/`aria` semantics at all, which is a reason to converge EVENTUALLY, not a reason to delete now. Measured on agentregistry (285 pages, EN+JA): with the fork removed, visible text and document structure are byte-for-byte identical and Hextra's `tabs.js` drives the variant-B markup correctly, including the nested group on the install guide — so the `&#10;` encoding is not load-bearing there. `tabRightAlign` in the fork has **zero call sites** in `content/` and `assets/` and can be dropped from it today |
| `layouts/_shortcodes/reuse-append.html` | **DELETE — verdict measured, action outstanding.** Extras adopted this shortcode in 0.3.3 and fixed its asset lookup for an assembled assets tree in 0.3.5, which is the only thing the hub's copy was doing differently. The deletion was verified on a real hub build at the time: with the hub's file removed and the module resolving, `agentgateway` builds exit 0 (2759 EN + 829 JA pages), and all 6 call sites on `standalone/latest/llm/providers/azure/` render a single joined `<table>` with zero stray pipe rows. The negative control was run first — deleting the file while pinned to 0.3.4 aborts the build — so the pin floor is real. The hub is pinned to **0.3.6**, above that floor, so this is actionable now. Extras' copy is also strictly more correct here: it resolves the version through `utils/version-root.html`, which distinguishes `version` from `linkVersion`, and those differ on two hub products |
| `layouts/partials/version-banner.html` | **DELETE, BUT NOT ALONE — the deletion needs a config move in the same commit.** Extras added section-scoped banners in 0.3.5, so the file's own instruction ("DELETE THIS FILE once docs-theme-extras supports a section-scoped banner") is satisfied. The two implementations read **different config keys**, which is the trap: the hub's reads `[params.sections.standalone]`, extras' reads `[params.versions.sectionBanners.standalone]` on the matched version entry. Delete the file without moving the keys and the standalone preview banner silently disappears, and the version banner it was suppressing returns in its place — the same class of failure the override was written to fix, only inverted. The keys are duplicated in **three** config files (`hugo-agentgateway.toml`, `hugo-local-agentgateway.toml`, `hugo-preview-agentgateway.toml`), so all three need the move |

**Why those last two are listed rather than left red.** Both were recorded as follow-ups in
the 0.3.5 release notes — "both are deleted once this tag lands and the hub's pin is bumped."
The tag landed, the pin went to 0.3.6, and the deletions did not happen. Nothing tracked them,
because the one mechanism designed to track exactly this was left failing instead of
baselined, and a spec that is always red is a spec everyone learns to scroll past. Entering
them here reverses that: the suite goes green, and the ratchet's `stale` arm now fails the
moment the hub deletes either file, forcing this inventory to be edited rather than quietly
drifting. **They are accepted, not settled.** The verdict for both is delete.

**Resolved (v0.2.0-beta.3):**

- `layouts/_shortcodes/gloss.html` deleted. Functionally identical to extras' but **not
  flattened**, so it injected newline runs into the middle of sentences. Measured on a
  before/after `PRODUCT=kgateway` build: **29 pages differ, every edit pure whitespace** —
  42 removals of `&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;` and 18 of a stray space, zero content changes. The
  visible wins are small but real: body text went from `you install the Solo Enterprise for
  kgateway ⏎⏎⏎ control plane ⏎⏎⏎ in a Kubernetes cluster` to one clean sentence, and the
  `<meta name="description">` on `2.1.x/about/architecture` went from `data plane . These`
  to `data plane. These`. This is the same flatten rationale as `reuse.html` and `alert.html`.
- `layouts/_shortcodes/table.html` deleted. All **18** hub call sites pass no argument, so
  there is no collision with extras' `mode=` parameter (the hub's took a positional CSS
  class; extras' takes `wrap`/`nowrap`/`equal`). **12 pages change**, all
  `gateway/*/reference/helm/*_helm_chart_values`, and the change is real markup:
  `<div class="hx:overflow-x-auto">` becomes
  `<div class="solo-table solo-table--wrap" style="--solo-table-cols: 4">`. Scroll is
  preserved either way — `.table-wrapper` already carries `overflow-x: auto`, and the inner
  `.table-wrapper` is present in both builds — so the net effect is that cells stop being
  capped at 24rem and fill the body width, which is exactly what `wrap` mode documents.
  **Flag for the visual pass**: this is the one item in this batch that changes appearance
  rather than whitespace.

**`gloss.html` came BACK, and the unreleased tag makes it deletable again.** The file deleted above
returned as a fork of extras v0.3.12, for a different reason: it routed the "Learn more"
href through `custom/glossary-link.html` (rewriting OSS-authored links onto this site's
product and version) and emitted `target="_blank"` only for an external destination. Both
behaviors are now in the module — the rewrite is the DEFAULT of the
`docs/glossary-link.html` extension slot, and the conditional target/rel is in `gloss.html`
— so on the next pin bump the hub deletes **both** its `gloss.html` and its
`custom/glossary-link.html`, keeping only `_shortcodes/glossary-list.html` and pointing its
one call at `docs/glossary-link.html`. The verdict is delete.

**It is now baselined, reversing the decision this paragraph used to record.** The previous
text withheld it from `tests/helpers/override-baseline.json` on the grounds that baselining
"would turn the ratchet green and remove the only thing tracking the deletion, which is
exactly how `reuse-append.html` and `version-banner.html` above went three releases
unactioned." That reasoning is wrong about the mechanism, and it contradicts the paragraph
two rows up, which baselines those same two files *for the purpose of tracking them*. The
ratchet has two arms: `added` fails when a consumer grows a shadow, and `stale` fails when a
baselined shadow **disappears**. So a baselined entry is not an untracked one — the moment
the hub deletes `gloss.html`, `stale` goes red and forces this file to be edited. That is
strictly more tracking than a permanently red `added` arm, which tracks nothing and trains
everyone to scroll past a failing suite. The three deletions are tracked the same way
because they are the same kind of thing: accepted today, scheduled to go, and impossible to
remove quietly.

The hub is pinned to **v0.3.13**, below the unreleased tag that makes the deletion possible,
so this is not actionable yet even in principle — one more reason a red `added` arm was
measuring nothing but the passage of time.

That deletion is **inert today**, which is worth knowing before scheduling it. The only
`data/glossary.yaml` any hub build can currently reach is agentgateway's, via
`.oss-clones/agentgateway*/worktrees/main/`, and it defines **zero** `link:` values — so
neither the fork's rewrite nor the module's replacement has anything to fire on. The
"19 links, all 404" measurement in the fork's own header dates from when the hub had
kagent's glossary; the hub builds no kagent product today. The fork is therefore dormant
code with a live maintenance cost, and the module now covers the case for whenever that
data returns.

**SEPARATE FINDING — the glossary feature is DEAD on the docs hub.** Not caused by the
deletion above, and not fixed by it. Both `gloss.html` versions look the key up in
`site.Data.glossary` and fall back to plain text on a miss. `kgateway.dev` ships
`data/glossary.yaml`, but the hub's module import declares **explicit mounts**
(`content/docs`, `assets/kgw-docs/*`), and explicit mounts REPLACE the defaults — so the
module's `data/` is never mounted and every lookup misses. Measured in production:
`docs.solo.io/kgateway/latest/about/architecture/` has **0** `glossary-term` spans and **0**
tooltips; the same page on `kgateway.dev` has **4** of each. So 26 terms that carry hover
definitions on the OSS site render as bare text on the hub, with no error and no missing
content — just a missing affordance. This is the same trap already recorded for the solo
icon. Fix is one mount (`source = "data"`, `target = "data"`) in `hugo-kgateway.toml`, plus
`hugo-gateway.toml` and `hugo-agentregistry.toml` which import the same module — but it needs
a check that the merged `data/` does not collide with the hub's own keys, so it is its own
change. Deliberately left as a backlog item.

**Not shadows at all, despite looking like candidates:** `icon.html` (394B) and
`doc-test.html` (20B) have no counterpart in extras — extras' `icon` is a PARTIAL
(`_partials/utils/icon.html`), not a shortcode. `icon` is **live** (4 uses arriving via the
pinned kgateway.dev module, invisible to a grep of the hub's own tree). `doc-test` has 0 uses
in the hub, its assets, the pinned kgateway.dev module and ambientmesh.io — but
agentgateway.dev has **364**, so it is a cheap compatibility shim, not dead code. Keep both.

**Resolved (unreleased):** the 169 duplicated selectors are gone (`custom.css` 26,997 →
5,008 bytes), the three byte-identical asset duplicates were deleted
(`assets/css/main.css`, `assets/js/core/toc-scroll.js`, `assets/js/flexsearch.js`), and
`layouts/_shortcodes/reuse.html` was deleted after its only live divergence — a
`flatten-rendered` call — was upstreamed. Its other divergence, a lone-`<p>` unwrap, was
verified dead first: `.Page.RenderString` with no options renders at `display:"inline"`,
which never wraps single-line content in `<p>`, so the condition was unreachable.
Deleting the override changed **0 of 1,555** built pages.

**Not in the module at all:** `docs/layouts/_shortcodes/tabs.html` and `tab.html`. extras
ships no tabs shortcode; Hextra provides it. Hextra v0.12.3 emits `hextra-tabs-panel` /
`hextra-tabs-toggle`; the hub's override emits `hextra-tab-panel` / `hextra-tab-btn` /
`hextra-tab-panels`. **Verified consequence:** any extras spec matching tab classes is
fixture-only-valid. This is exactly how `tab-code-fences.spec.ts` came to sit in no
`testMatch` allowlist *and* carry a selector that matched no fixture output.

### kgateway-oss

Four same-path shadows remain (five before `link-hextra.html` was deleted).

| shadow | verdict |
|---|---|
| `layouts/_partials/navbar.html` | **KEEP.** 29,118B against extras' 20,921B — a full fork with its own class vocabulary (`nav-container`, `dropdown`, `github-white-icon`) rather than extras' (`hextra-nav-container`, `version-dropdown`, `solo-sidebar-trigger-tabletonly`). Deleting it is a visual redesign of the site header, not a cleanup |
| `layouts/404.html` | **KEEP for now — revisit.** Predates extras' own `layouts/404.html` (v0.3.1) and does a job that one deliberately does not: it AUTO-REDIRECTS for this site's `/docs/{version}/` → `/docs/envoy/{version}/` restructure, and hardcodes the `envoy` and `agentgateway` section names. It also renders `nav.html`, so it is the one 404 in the fleet with site chrome. Deleting it would drop those restructure redirects on the floor. See the note below |
| `layouts/partials/docs/width-class.html` | **SLOT OVERRIDE — sanctioned.** Routes the wrapper class through `utils/page-width` so this site's `page.width: wide` is honoured |
| `layouts/partials/docs/content-class.html` | **SLOT OVERRIDE — sanctioned.** `hx:max-w-6xl` content column |

**On the 404 shadow (v0.3.1).** These two files now overlap in purpose, and the overlap is
worth closing later rather than now. Both answer "the reader is on a URL that does not
exist, in a versioned tree"; they differ on what to do about it. kgateway-oss AUTO-REDIRECTS
(`window.location.assign`) on a guess derived from a regex over `/docs/([a-zA-Z0-9.]+)/`,
with no check that the destination exists — so a wrong guess replaces one broken URL with
another, and the reader cannot see what happened. Extras probes with HEAD and OFFERS a link
it has confirmed resolves. The kgateway rules are also genuinely site-specific: no other
consumer has a `/docs/envoy/` section split.

Converging them means teaching extras' 404 a consumer-supplied "path rewrite" hook and
proving the restructure redirects still fire, which is its own change with its own tests.
Until then this shadow is correct, and the cost is that kgateway-oss does not get the
version-aware suggestions the other consumers get.

**Resolved (v0.2.0-beta.3):** `layouts/docs/single.html` and `layouts/docs/list.html`
deleted, replaced by the two slot overrides above. The site **gained a visible page
subtitle on 856 pages** it had silently been missing, plus
`components/page-context-menu`, the `displayPagination` guard and the `page-badges`
contract. (Its `<meta name="description">` was already correct — a different partial
feeds that — so the gain is the rendered `<p class="page-description">`, not SEO.)
Two other things moved on the way out: the inline breadcrumb-hiding `<style>` went to
`assets/css/custom.css`, and the `/docs/envoy/` landing became
`layouts/docs/landing.html`, selected by `layout: landing` in front matter, instead of
an `if $isEnvoyIndex` branch keyed on a hardcoded path. That landing renders
byte-identically apart from the stylesheet fingerprint. 154 content + 1,155 static +
7 browser specs pass.

Also noted while doing this: `layouts/docs/envoy/_index.html` and
`layouts/docs/agentgateway/_index.html` are **dead files**. Hugo has no lookup path of
the form `layouts/<section>/<subsection>/_index.html`, so neither has ever rendered.
Left in place pending a separate cleanup.

**Resolved (v0.2.0-beta.2):** `layouts/_shortcodes/link-hextra.html` deleted. The version-root
fix in that release makes the 587B fork redundant. Verified by a before/after
`hugo160 --gc --minify` build: **104 of 1,161 pages differ, 130 href changes, every one a
trailing slash being ADDED** (`/quickstart/install` → `/quickstart/install/`, one fewer
redirect) — zero links retargeted, zero link-count changes, and the remaining 438 non-HTML
diffs are `llms.txt` timestamps plus the same slashes. 154 content + 1,155 static specs pass.

### agentgateway-oss-website

Two of the four same-path shadows below are **transitional, and count UPWARD for a good
reason**: `github-yaml.html` and `reuse-append.html` were adopted INTO the module from this
consumer, so the shadow appeared because the module grew, not because agw drifted. The
ratchet cannot tell those two cases apart, which is why both rows carry an explicit deletion
deadline (the next pin bump) rather than a KEEP verdict. If they are still here after agw
moves off `v0.2.1`, that is drift and they should be deleted.

Two unsanctioned same-path shadows plus five sanctioned slot overrides (nine unsanctioned
before the image pair, the two forks and the two docs layouts below were resolved). Three
arrived on 2026-08-06 in the
commit "Moved shortcodes to `_shortcodes`": those files already existed under the old
`layouts/shortcodes/` path, where they did NOT collide with the module, and moving them made
them shadow it.

**This consumer's shadow set depends on which branch the clone has checked out**, so the
ratchet is only meaningful against a known branch. Over one working session the scanner saw
the set change four times as the clone moved between `kkb-mcp-gaps` and `kkb-theme-upgrade`;
`layouts/partials/announcement.html` exists on some branches and not others. The snapshot
below is `kkb-theme-upgrade` at `dd7f0083`. **Re-run `npm run scan:overrides` against the
release branch before trusting these counts**, and expect this consumer, not the module, to
be the reason the ratchet goes red.

That is exactly what happened on 2026-08-07. The snapshot was taken at `3769c7c2`, where
`layouts/partials/announcement.html` had been deleted; `dd7f0083` then merged `origin/main`,
which carried a *modification* to that file (`9317b55d`, "Remove Govern AI Costs workshop
banner"). A modify/delete merge resolves in favour of the modification, so the override came
back and the ratchet went red on a file no module change had touched. It is re-listed below
rather than re-deleted: agw's copy is a real 3.1KB site-specific fork (the AAIF banner — a
dismissible fixed bar, `localStorage` dismissal, and an `agw-has-banner` class that shifts
the fixed navbars down) against extras' generic 1.5KB partial, so deleting it would drop the
banner. Re-check this after the theme-upgrade branch merges.

**SIZE IS NOT EVIDENCE OF STALENESS.** The rows below used to be described purely by byte
gap, on the assumption that a fork much smaller than the module's file is an old copy to
delete. Measured — delete each fork, rebuild, diff the built HTML — **that assumption is
wrong for at least two of them.** They are small because they do a *different, simpler job
that is correct for this site's URL shape*, and deleting them breaks pages. Every row now
carries a measured verdict instead of a byte count.

| file | measured verdict |
|---|---|
| `layouts/_partials/navbar.html` | **KEEP.** 832B against extras' 20.9KB. Deleting changes **1515 pages** and renders extras' full navbar with dropdowns — a visual redesign of the site header, not a cleanup |
| `layouts/partials/announcement.html` | **KEEP.** 3,092B against extras' 1,509B. Not a stale copy: it is the AAIF banner — a dismissible fixed bar with `localStorage` dismissal and an `agw-has-banner` class that offsets the fixed navbars. Resurrected by the `origin/main` merge at `dd7f0083`; see the branch note above |
| `layouts/partials/docs/chrome-top.html` | **SLOT OVERRIDE — sanctioned.** The navbar-hiding CSS, `nav.html` and the announcement wrapper. This one file replaced two forked layouts |
| `layouts/partials/docs/chrome-bottom.html` | **SLOT OVERRIDE — sanctioned.** `chatbot.html` |
| `layouts/partials/docs/width-class.html` | **SLOT OVERRIDE — sanctioned.** `utils/page-width` plus the `agw-docs-topgap` hook class |
| `layouts/partials/docs/content-class.html` | **SLOT OVERRIDE — sanctioned.** `hx:pt-2` rather than the default `hx:pt-6` |
| `layouts/partials/docs/under-heading.html` | **TRANSITIONAL — delete on the 0.4.0 bump**, together with `layouts/partials/test-status-badge.html` and the `.test-status-*` rules in `custom.css`. From 0.4.0 `docs/single.html` renders the badge itself (`components/test-status-badge.html`), so keeping this override renders two badges. Until then: **SLOT OVERRIDE — sanctioned.** `test-status-badge.html`. **Not inert, despite what this row said before 0.3.8.** The badge is gated on `.Params.test_status`, which no committed page carries — so a local build from source renders it zero times, which is what "inert" was measured against. CI injects the field into front matter (`make test-status` → `scripts/doc_test_inject_status.py`) before the production build, and only for the `latest` and `main` version trees (`TESTED_VERSIONS` in `scripts/doc_test_run.py`), so it is live on the real site: see [`/docs/kubernetes/latest/install/helm/`](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/latest/install/helm/). Moved here from `after-title.html` in 0.3.8 so the badge stays above the copy/context buttons when the title area stacks on a narrow viewport. Do not delete this slot as unused |
| `layouts/_shortcodes/github-yaml.html` | **TRANSITIONAL — delete on the next pin bump.** Not drift in the usual direction: the module's copy was taken FROM this file, so agw shadowed the module the moment the module gained it. agw pins `v0.2.1`, which has no `github-yaml`, so deleting the fork before the pin moves breaks 22 pages. Delete it in the same PR that bumps the pin, then remove this row and the baseline entry. The module's copy is not byte-identical — it fixes a `path.Dir`-derived `base_url` that emitted `https:/host/…` with one slash, and its dead-URL branch now `errorf`s instead of warning |
| `layouts/_shortcodes/reuse-append.html` | **TRANSITIONAL — delete on the next pin bump.** Same situation and same deadline as `github-yaml` above. 2 call sites, both in `llm/providers/azure.md`. The module's copy is behaviourally identical; only the doc comment grew |
| ~~`layouts/_shortcodes/openapi.html`~~ | **DELETED 2026-08-17 — it was emitting invalid HTML.** Affects **7** pages, not the 2 recorded here before. Measured by deleting the fork and diffing the whole build: exactly those 7 pages change out of 2,237, nothing else. The fork emits a complete standalone document *inside* the docs page template, so every one of those pages shipped with **2 `<!doctype>`, 2 `<html>` and 2 `<body>` tags**; extras' version emits a fragment and the page has 1 of each. Browser-checked side by side on `/docs/kubernetes/latest/llm/guardrails/webhook/openapi-spec/`: both render Swagger UI with 2 operations and the same live title ("GuardRail Webhook API 0.1.0 OAS 3.1"), and both carry the same 2 pre-existing `invalid_request` page errors, so nothing regressed. Extras' version is also a strict superset on network resilience (`try` 6 vs 2, `timeout` 5 vs 4, `warnf` 5 vs 3, `GetRemote` 4 vs 1, plus a client-side unpkg fallback) and adds `src=` for a local spec. `make framework-test` after deletion: 2455 passed, 0 failed (4 flaky, all `console-errors` on unrelated pages) |

One accepted duplicated selector:

| Selector | Why it stays |
| --- | --- |
| `custom.css :: :root` | **KEEP.** One property in common, `--solo-navbar-bottom`. Extras computes it as `calc(var(--navbar-height, 4rem) + var(--hextra-banner-height, 0rem))`; agw sets it to `var(--agw-navbar-h)`. This consumer forks `navbar.html` down to 832B and hides Hextra's chrome entirely (see the `chrome-top.html` slot above), so extras' navbar-height variables do not describe its header — pointing the token at agw's own measured height is the correct adaptation, and the same shape as ambientmesh's `.nav-container` font swap. The two `shared-name only` selectors the scanner also reports here are not duplication and are not listed: extras and agw set no property in common on them |

**Resolved (v0.2.0-beta.3):** `layouts/docs/single.html` and `layouts/docs/list.html`
deleted, replaced by the five slot overrides above. Verified feature-by-feature on a
before/after `--gc --minify` build: the custom navbar (1,512 pages), chatbot (1,492),
section cards (477 pages / 2,091 links / 510 grids) and page descriptions (841) all carry
**identical counts**, and no page vanished. The hand-rolled section-card block in the old
`list.html` was dropped in favour of the module's `auto-section-cards.html`, which is a
strict superset of it (same markup and badges, plus SVG/data-icon support). The inline
`padding-top: 2.5rem` moved to `assets/css/custom.css` behind an `agw-docs-topgap` hook
class supplied by the width-class slot — note that if this site ever enables docTabs, the
module emits an inline `padding-top` on the same element and inline wins, so that rule
needs revisiting at that point. 1,705 content + static + browser specs pass.

**Resolved (v0.2.0-beta.2) — the two forks that were previously marked KEEP:**

- `layouts/_shortcodes/link-hextra.html` (940B). Previously KEEP, because deleting it against
  an older pin rewrote links on **913 pages** from `/docs/kubernetes/1.0.x/setup/gateway/` to
  `/latest/setup/gateway/`, a 404. The version-root fix in beta.2 removes that. Verified by a
  before/after `hugo160 --gc --minify` build: **356 of 1,516 pages differ, 535 href changes,
  every one a trailing slash being ADDED** — zero links retargeted, zero link-count changes.
- `assets/js/flexsearch.js` (20,929B). The entire fork existed for one expression: extras read
  `site.Params.versions`, agw reads `site.Params.sections.*.versions` keyed on `linkVersion`.
  extras now walks both and keys on `linkVersion | default .version`, matching what
  `utils/warn-missing-description.html` already did. Verified: the built search bundle keeps
  the **same fingerprint hash** with the fork gone, i.e. byte-identical output.

1,699 content + static specs pass on the fork-free build, and the build's warning count is
unchanged. Note that this repo's `Makefile` has **no `framework-test-content` target** (kgw
has one), so the content project has to be run by hand from the extras checkout — worth
adding.

**Resolved 2026-08-07 — the image shortcodes, which had to move as a set:**
`reuse-image.html` and `reuse-image-dark.html` were deleted, along with the
`.light-only` / `.dark-only` CSS block in `custom.css` and the two hand-written `<div>`s in
`content/docs/_index.md` that used those class names. They could not be split: extras emits
`class="reuse-image-nodark"` on the light image and `class="toggle-light"` on the dark one,
and the rule that stops both showing at once is
`.dark .reuse-image-nodark:has(+ .toggle-light) { display: none }`. agw's forks emitted
`dark-only` instead, styled by its own CSS. Deleting either shortcode alone would have left
one image unpaired and rendered both in dark mode. Verified in a headless browser on
`/docs/standalone/latest/operations/debug/`: exactly one figure visible in light and one in
dark, in both directions.

### agentregistry-oss-website

**Now completely clean: zero of everything** — no same-path shadows, no duplicated
selectors, no contract divergences, no slot overrides.

**Resolved (v0.2.0-beta.3), and the premise was backwards.** This entry used to read
"`assets/css/main.css` at 1863B against extras' 13368B — worth checking whether that is
intentional or is silently dropping theme CSS." It was neither. The two files have nothing to
do with each other:

- agentregistry's is a **Tailwind entry point** (`@import "tailwindcss"`, `@source
  "hugo_stats.json"`, brand keyframes, HSL design tokens), read by that repo's own
  `layouts/_partials/css.html`. **No other consumer ships a `css.html`, and neither does
  Hextra 0.12.3** (its entry is `assets/css/styles.css`; it has no `main.css` at all). So
  agentregistry is not overriding a theme file — it is supplying the only file that reads
  that path.
- extras' was **668 lines of marketing CSS** (proxima-nova, 4rem `h1`, `.p-lead`) dating from
  the "First draft" commit, and **loaded by no template in any of the seven repos or in
  Hextra.** Verified by grepping every `resources.Get`/`Match` call for CSS across all of
  them: every lookup is by explicit path and none is `css/main.css` except agentregistry's.

So the fix was to delete **extras'** copy, not to touch agentregistry's. Verified by build:
the fixture is unchanged (0 non-`llms.txt` diffs) and agentregistry's build differs only in
11 `llms.txt` timestamps — **0 HTML pages, 0 CSS files**, with its own Tailwind bundle keeping
the identical fingerprint `main.7a32dc4c…css`. The docs hub had already deleted its
byte-identical copy of the same dead file, with no effect, which corroborates this.

**Lesson worth keeping:** a byte-count gap between two files at the same path is not evidence
of drift. These two shared a filename and nothing else. Same mistake shape as the `link-hextra`
"587B stub vs 6KB module file" reading, which also turned out to be wrong.

### kagent oss and ambientmesh.io

**kagent oss' Hugo root is `docs-site/`, not the repo root.** The repo root is a
Next.js marketing site (`next.config.mjs`, `open-next.config.ts`, no `go.mod`) — the Hugo
docs, `go.mod`, and the extras pin all live under `kagent-oss-website/docs-site/`. Point
`scan:overrides` (and any manual `hugo`/`git` check) there, or it looks like this consumer
doesn't use the module at all. `tests/helpers/scan-overrides.ts` already knows this; this note exists so
a human doing the same check by hand doesn't draw the same wrong conclusion.

**kagent oss carries four same-path shadows**, all four now baselined and reviewed below:
`_shortcodes/gloss.html`, `_partials/utils/section-segment.html`,
`partials/utils/version-noindex.html` and `partials/version-banner.html`. Every one is a
deliberate fork carrying a "why this exists" header, and three of the four exist because the
module gets something wrong on a site shape it was not written for, not because kagent
drifted. That distinction is the point of the table: a KEEP here is a note that extras owes
this consumer a fix, not that the consumer is misbehaving.

| shadow | verdict |
|---|---|
| `layouts/_shortcodes/gloss.html` | **DELETE on the next pin bump.** Its only deltas were `hugo.Data` (issue #58, handled module-wide) and emitting `target="_blank"` only for an external link. Both are in the module now, so the fork has nothing left to do — see the paragraph below for the measurement |
| `layouts/_partials/utils/section-segment.html` | **KEEP — and it names its own retirement condition.** A one-line fork: upstream computes `$accept = or $nextIsVersion $isLanding` on a versioned site, kagent's adds `$atDocsRoot`. The site is versioned and version-less at once — kagent nests `0.x`/`1.x` under `/docs/kagent/`, kmcp has no version axis, and one Hugo build serves both. Declaring kagent's versions is mandatory (`site.Params.versions` is the only list the module reads), which puts the whole build on the versioned branch, where every kmcp page below `/docs/kmcp/` resolved to NO section. That collapsed `utils/resolve-sections.html` to one entry and rendered no section selector, so from any kmcp page there was no way back into the kagent docs. The fork's own header says to retire it "if the module makes (c) unconditional" — **that is an extras backlog item, not a kagent one** |
| `layouts/partials/utils/version-noindex.html` | **KEEP — upstream bug on a baseURL with a path.** kagent's `baseURL` is `https://kagent.dev/docs/`, so every `RelPermalink` carries a `/docs/` segment that comes from the baseURL PATH rather than a content directory. Upstream passes `utils/version-root.html`'s `lookupPath` straight to `site.GetPage`, which resolves relative to `contentDir` and so never matches a path carrying that prefix. Related to the known finding that 12 files parse URLs independently; the durable fix is upstream |
| `layouts/partials/version-banner.html` | **KEEP — upstream bug, same root cause as the hub's.** Upstream substring-matches `.FirstSection.RelPermalink` (always the top-level section) against `.linkVersion`, which cannot see a version nested a level deeper, and reads only the site-wide `Site.Params.versions`, which kagent leaves unset because the build also serves kmcp. The fork resolves versions the way `navbar.html`'s override and `version-cards.html` do, from `Site.Params.sections.<section>.versions` |

They are baselined rather than left red for the reason given in the `docs` section: the
ratchet's `stale` arm turns a baselined entry into a tripwire that fires the moment the file
is deleted, whereas a permanently red `added` arm tracks nothing and teaches everyone to
ignore the suite.

`gloss.html` is the one the unreleased tag resolves. Its only deltas were `hugo.Data` (see issue #58,
which handles that deprecation module-wide) and emitting `target="_blank"` only for an
external link. kagent's glossary holds **22 links and all 22 are site-relative**, so before
this release every glossary cross-reference in its own docset opened a second tab. The
conditional target/rel is now in the module, so the fork can go on the next pin bump — kagent
oss is on **v0.3.12**, so that bump has to happen first; it picks up the link-rewriting slot
at the same time, which it does not currently need.

One accepted duplicated selector, on ambientmesh only:

| Selector | Why it stays |
| --- | --- |
| `custom.css :: .nav-container` | `font-family: Figtree` where extras sets `Open Sans`. ambientmesh's brand font, deliberately different |

`print-book.css` (the Paged.js PDF-export book pipeline, `layouts/docs/list.book.html`) used
to be listed here as an ambientmesh-only override; both files now live in this module
(`assets/css/print-book.css`, `layouts/docs/list.book.html`) since the pattern proved out, so
there's no longer a same-path shadow to note — ambientmesh.io carries no local copy of either.
The pipeline's `scripts/render-pdf.mjs` followed the same way, but isn't a module mount at all
(`module.mounts` in `hugo.toml` only covers `layouts`/`assets`/`data`) — a consumer's Makefile
curls it from GitHub instead, pinned to its own `go.mod` version for this module, so there's
never a local copy to fall out of sync in the first place. See the CHANGELOG entry for details.

### The CSS duplication that used to be listed here, and why the count fell to one

An earlier revision reported 12 duplicated selectors on `agentgateway-oss-website`, 13 on
`kagent-oss-website` and 3 on `ambientmesh.io`, and concluded that `.hextra-toc` "is
redefined divergently by four of the six consumers, which suggests extras' own rule may be
the wrong default." **That conclusion was wrong, and so were most of the counts.**

The scanner compared SELECTOR NAMES, not properties. extras sets
`.hextra-toc { display: none }`; the four consumers set `font-family` on the same class
from a Tailwind `styles.css`. Different properties never collide, so nobody was overriding
anything. `scan-overrides.ts` now compares property-by-property and reports three separate
buckets — *redundant* (same value, safe to delete), *DIVERGENT* (a shared property really
differs), and *shared-name only* (ignore).

Against the corrected scanner the real figures were 10 conflicts each on agentgateway-oss
and kagent-oss — the identical block, copy-pasted between the two sites — of which only
three carried a genuinely different value. Those were resolved in favour of the module:

| Selector | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| `.nav-container`, `.hextra-tabs-toggle`, `.hextra-tabs-toggle:hover`, `.dark .hextra-tabs-toggle`, `.dark .hextra-tabs-toggle:hover` | byte-identical to extras — deleted |
| `.sidebar-link.sidebar-active-item` | `#1e40af` vs extras' `rgb(30, 64, 175)`, the same colour — deleted |
| `.dark .sidebar-link.sidebar-active-item` | same colour but `!important`. Measured inert (computed style unchanged after deletion) — deleted |
| `.hextra-tabs-toggle[data-state="selected"]` (+ `.dark`) | underline hardcoded `hsl(212,100%,50%)`; extras uses `var(--theme-primary)` — deleted, underline now follows the brand token and adapts in dark mode |
| `.section-cards` (+ both media queries) | `margin-top: 1rem` vs extras' `1.5rem` — deleted, extras wins |

Verified by computed-style diff on a real minified `agentgateway-oss-website` build across
two pages in both colour schemes: **6 differences across 12 snapshots, all three intended
changes × light and dark, nothing incidental.** Note `!important` is treated as part of the
value by the scanner, so a rule matching extras' colour but adding `!important` still
reports DIVERGENT — deleting it changes what wins against other sheets even when the
declared value matches.

## Enforcement

This document is the prose half of a two-part inventory. The machine half is
`tests/helpers/override-baseline.json`, and `tests/override-parity.spec.ts` holds the two
together as a **one-way ratchet**:

- a shadow that is not in the baseline **fails** — adding one has to be deliberate;
- a baseline entry a consumer no longer has **also fails**, so the list shrinks as
  consumers are cleaned up instead of silently going stale;
- every consumer with accepted shadows must have a section here, and every same-path
  shadow must be named **inside that consumer's own section** — a document-wide name match
  was too weak, since `kgateway-oss` and `agentgateway-oss-website` both fork
  `navbar.html` and one mention would have vacuously satisfied both.

**The cross-repo half does not run in CI**, because it needs the consumer clones as
siblings. It is a pre-release check for a developer machine. The scanner's own unit tests
do run everywhere, since a false negative there disarms everything else.

That scope note used to be the whole story, and it hid something worse than a gap in
coverage. With no clones present the scanner was never called, so the ratchet generated **no
tests at all** — a CI run reported nothing, not even a skip, and a green suite looked
identical whether the most important assertion in the file had passed or had never been
evaluated. `cross-repo coverage › every consumer in the inventory was actually scanned` closes
that: it is generated on every fixture run, it skips **by name** when a clone is absent, and
it **fails** when `REQUIRE_CONSUMER_CLONES=1`. Set that variable for any release run.

**Never leave this spec red as a way of tracking work.** A permanently failing check is
indistinguishable from a broken one, and everybody learns to scroll past both. The hub's
`reuse-append.html` and `version-banner.html` were tracked that way for three releases and
their follow-ups were lost. If a shadow should go but has not gone, baseline it and write the
verdict in the table above — the `stale` arm then fails the day it is finally deleted, which
is the reminder you actually wanted.

## How to use this before shipping a theme change

1. Run `npm run scan:overrides`, then the ratchet with the release flag set:

   ```bash
   REQUIRE_CONSUMER_CLONES=1 make test-oss
   ```

   Confirm nothing new appeared, and that `cross-repo coverage` **passed** rather than
   skipped — a skip means one or more consumers went unchecked and names them.
2. For every file or selector the change touches, check this inventory for a shadow.
3. If a shadow exists, the consumer needs a paired change in the same release — a pin bump
   alone will not take effect, and may make things worse (see the ordered-list fix).
4. Verify on a real consumer build, not only the fixture. See the verification standard in
   the Phase 3 plan: build all eight docs products plus kgw-oss and agw-oss against a local
   `replace`, sweep the built HTML for the invariants touched, and spot-check visually.
